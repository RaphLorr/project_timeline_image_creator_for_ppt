# Project Timeline Image Creator for PPT

## Vision
An interactive app that lets users build project timelines, renders them as images (from HTML), and inserts them into PowerPoint presentations.

## Core Workflow
1. User inputs project basic data: project name, timeline 颗粒度(by day? by week? by month?), draft start and end data.
2. Interatively add items in the timeline (each working item)
3. App renders a visual timeline from HTML/CSS
4. Timeline is exported as an image or exported as original HTML/CSS

## Open Questions
<!-- Draft your answers here as you refine requirements -->

- What input format? (form UI, JSON, CSV, spreadsheet?)
- What timeline styles? (horizontal, vertical, Gantt-like?)
- Single image or multiple slides?
- Desktop app, web app, or CLI?
- Edit existing PPT or generate new one?
