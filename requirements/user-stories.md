# User Stories

## Project Setup
- As a user, I want to set my project name, date range, and granularity so that a blank timeline grid is generated for me.
- As a user, I want to switch granularity (day/week/month) after setup so that I can zoom in or out on my timeline.

## Click & Drag Timeline Building
- As a user, I want to click on an empty grid cell to create a new timeline item so that I don't need to fill out forms or type dates manually.
- As a user, I want to drag the right edge of an item to change its duration so that I can quickly adjust how long a task takes.
- As a user, I want to drag an item left or right to reschedule it so that I can reposition tasks without re-entering data.
- As a user, I want to drag an item up or down to reorder rows so that I can organize my timeline visually.
- As a user, I want to double-click an item to edit its name and color so that I can label and categorize my tasks.
- As a user, I want to select an item and press Delete to remove it so that I can clean up mistakes quickly.

## Visual Feedback
- As a user, I want to see a ghost/preview bar while dragging so that I know exactly where the item will land.
- As a user, I want items to snap to the grid so that everything stays aligned to my chosen granularity.
- As a user, I want to see the rendered timeline update live as I make changes so that I always know what the final output looks like.

## Templates
- As a user, I want to pick a template when creating a project so that the timeline matches my client's visual style from the start.
- As a user, I want to switch templates at any time so that I can try different looks without re-entering data.
- As a user, I want to duplicate and customize a template so that I can create a variation for a specific client.
- As a user, I want the AI color suggestions to respect my active template's palette so that everything stays on-brand.
- (Phase 2) As a user, I want to upload an image of an example timeline and have the AI generate a matching template so that I can quickly replicate a client's existing style.
- (Phase 2) As a user, I want to fine-tune an AI-generated template so that I can fix anything the model got wrong.

## AI Categorization & Colors
- As a user, I want the app to auto-categorize my task when I type its name so that I don't have to manually pick a category every time.
- As a user, I want the AI to suggest a color for each category so that my timeline has a professional, consistent color scheme without manual effort.
- As a user, I want the AI to consider my existing items when categorizing a new task so that categories stay consistent across the project.
- As a user, I want to override any AI suggestion (category or color) so that I stay in control of the final result.
- As a user, I want the AI to remember my overrides so that future suggestions respect my preferences.
- As a user, I want the timeline to still work if the AI is unavailable so that I'm never blocked from building my timeline.

## Export
- As a user, I want to export my timeline as a high-res PNG so that it looks crisp when inserted into PowerPoint.
- As a user, I want to export the timeline as standalone HTML/CSS so that I can tweak it later or share it as a web page.
